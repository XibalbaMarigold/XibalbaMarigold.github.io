<h1> Causes of Stress </h1>

<h4> School life </h4>

<p> School is a major part of an adolescence’s life as they spend a large part of their day there. There is very little surprise when it comes to links between schooling and stressed out teenagers. Many people believe the reason behind this especially in Australia, is due to the large focus on academic outcomes and the idea that grades determine one’s future. </p>
<p> “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a FISH by its ability to climb a tree,
it will live its whole life believing that it is STUPID”
-	Matthew Kelly, ‘The Rhythm of Life:
Living Every Day with Passion and Purpose, 2004’ </p>

<p> Studies have shown that nearly half (47%) of Australian school kids are stressed in their every day life due to academic studies. This stress has been linked to lower academic achievement among the children suffering. </p>

<h4> Friendships </h4>

<p> Friendships are a major part of anyone’s support network and when these friendships falter it can put strain on a person. A study conducted in 2017 by the University of Michigan State suggested that people gain more both physically and mentally from friendships rather than their family. The results showed that people who believed they had stronger friendships were less likely to develop serious illnesses later in life. </p>
<p> On the flip side, friends can also have a negative affect on people. If a friend exhibits behaviours such as lying, betrayal and insulting/ bullying, they can increase the stress levels of an individual. Especially when friends become overly needy and demanding of time, they can take away from other things such as school and increase stress levels. </p>

<h4> Relationships </h4>

<p> High school and teenage years is when most people begin to explore romantic relationships or their sexuality. The want or need for this to occur can often put a lot of strain on people as they grow up, it is a natural part of puberty to begin to feel attracted to other people. While relationships, much like friendships can build a person up and make them happier, when relationships are not as supportive or welcoming they can have a negative affect. </p>
<p> These negative affects can be forced on a person through many different ways. Pressure within a relationship to begin exploring the sexual side of intimacy is an issue that many people face that can cause extreme amounts of stress especially when someone is not ready to begin exploring such things, they may feel scared of their partner leaving them. </p>
<p> Grades can also be affected by a teens relationship, through spending more time with your significant other rather than doing school work or assignments. Not only can relationships affect the quality of classroom work, it can also affect social status within the school, teenagers can begin labelling their peers based on their relationship status or sexual activity. </p>

<h4> Family </h4>

<p> Parents can place a lot of expectations on adolescents in many different areas of life. Combining this with many other factors and stressors that come with some families, such as divorced or separated parents, siblings or general family life. </p>
<p> Parental separation is a stressful time for children to have to deal with, adding the combined stress of any of the above factors and it can quickly overload a teen. Teenagers need ongoing support from parental units within this time and may be lacking that due to the separation. </p>

<h5> Australian Defence Force Family </h5>

<p> Children and teens with parents who serve in the Australian Defence Force can find themselves being stressed for a number different reasons. As ADF families are constantly moving to follow the parent who is being posted, change of environment and having to adjust to such a thing can cause a lot of stress as a child is expected to settle into a new school, home and build new friendships with each move. Children dealing with deployed parents is another level of added stress, especially when the aren’t is deployed to an unsafe environment with the risk of loosing their life. </p>

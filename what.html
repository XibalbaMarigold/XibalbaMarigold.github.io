<h1> What is Stress? </h1>

<h2> Stress is defined as... </h2>

<h4> By the American Psychology Association: </h4>

<p>	“a feeling of being overwhelmed, worried or run-down.” (http://www.apa.org, n.d.) </p>

<h4> By Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: </h4>

<p>	“a physical, chemical, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and may be a factor in disease causation” (Merriam-webster.com, n.d.)</p>

 <h4> By Oxford Dictionary: </h4>

 <p> “a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances.”</p>

<p> Stress is a psychological process that is the body’s way of responding to uncomfortable or threatening situations. The reason behind why people experience stress is that stress is a protection method for the body. In certain situations, when there is a threat, stress is responsible for the response that can save an individual’s life.  (Oxford Dictionaries | English, n.d.)</p>

<h2> Theories of Stress </h2>

<h4> Frustration Agression Hypothesis </h4>

<p> The frustration Aggression hypothesis is the idea that when someone becomes frustrated or stressed about a certain event or situation, they release this through anger. It largely implies that aggression is a result of frustration. (Gonzalez, n.d.)
 </p>
<p> This links to stress through many different ways. Stress is a form of frustration that is generated when one is in an uncomfortable situation. The stress comes when an individual is attempting to achieve something however they are prevented from doing so whether it be through self inflicted or external barriers. </p>

<h4> Health Belief Model </h4>

<p> The health belief model is a psychological model that attempts to explain and predict health behaviours. This is done by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. The HBM has been adapted to explore a variety of long- and short-term health behaviours, including sexual risk behaviours and the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Your perceptions about your weight and the associated stress that comes with being unhealthy can prevent you from motivating yourself to exercise however, the HBM also allows for this stress to have a positive affect, explaining that it can also be a motivating factor in peopleâ€™s lives. (University of Twente, n.d.)

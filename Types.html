<h1> Types of Stress </h1>

<h2> Types of Stress include: </h2>

<h4> A. Acute Stress... </h4>

<p> …is the most common form of stress, present within everyday life. In small doses acute stress is rather healthy and beneficial, as the stress continues past this idea of ‘small’ is can become debilitating and rather exhausting.</p>
<p> … is a short term type of stress, generally not exceeding a few weeks. Due to the fact that acute stress is short term, it means it has no lasting or long-term effects on individuals.</p>
<p> …has many common symptoms including:
<p> -	Emotional distress in the form of anger, anxiety or depression.</p>
<p> -	Tension such as headaches, back pain, jaw pain and muscular tension.</p>
<p> -	Digestive system problems such as stomach aches, constipation and diarrhoea. </p>
<p> …is treatable and easily manageable.(http://www.apa.org, n.d.) </p>

<h4> B. Episodic Acute Stress... </h4>

<p> …is when acute stress is suffered from frequently. While is may die down occasionally, it is not as frequent as periods of calm between normal acute stress symptoms. </p>
<p> …usually caused by self-inflicted goals that are unreasonable or unrealistic. </p>
<p> …symptoms are generally in the form of: </p>
<p> -	Long periods of emotional distress in the form of depression, anxiety or anger. </p>
<p> -	Severe and prolonged periods of worry. </p>
<p> -	Physical symptoms much like with acute stress for prolonged periods of time. </p>
<p> -	Heart issues. (Sincero, 2012)</p>

<h4> C. Chronic Stress... </h4>

<p> …is seemingly unending periods of stress that become detrimental to an individual both physically and mentally. </p>
<p> …is caused by an overuse of the bodies stress response system. </p>
<p> …is a result of being constantly exposed to situations that are stressful for an individual and situations that cause the body to release the ‘stress hormones’. </p>
<p> …can cause many health issues such as heart diseases due to the fact that if the stress response system is overused, it begins effecting many other bodily systems including the cardiovascular system. (Humanstress.ca, n.d.) </p>

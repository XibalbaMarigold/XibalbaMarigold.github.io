<h1> What is Stress? </h1>

<h2> Stress is defined as... </h2>

<h4> By the American Psychology Association: </h4>

<p>	“a feeling of being overwhelmed, worried or run-down.” (http://www.apa.org, n.d.) </p>

<h4> By Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: </h4>

<p>	“a physical, chemical, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and may be a factor in disease causation” (Merriam-webster.com, n.d.)</p>

 <h4> By Oxford Dictionary: </h4>

    <center>
    <img class="helloFinalImage" src="../img/Capture.PNG>
    </center>

<p> Stress is a psychological process that is the body’s way of responding to uncomfortable or threatening situations. The reason behind why people experience stress is that stress is a protection method for the body. In certain situations, when there is a threat, stress is responsible for the response that can save an individual’s life.  (Oxford Dictionaries | English, n.d.)</p>

 <!-- <p> “a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances.”</p> -->

<h1> Types of Stress </h1>

<h2> Types of Stress include: </h2>

<h4> A. Acute Stress... </h4>

<p> …is the most common form of stress, present within everyday life. In small doses acute stress is rather healthy and beneficial, as the stress continues past this idea of ‘small’ is can become debilitating and rather exhausting.</p>
<p> … is a short term type of stress, generally not exceeding a few weeks. Due to the fact that acute stress is short term, it means it has no lasting or long-term effects on individuals.</p>
        <img class="../img/helloFirstImage" src="typesOfStressImageMeme.jpg" style="float: right;">

<p style="margin-left: 15%;"> …has many common symptoms including:
<p style="margin-left: 15%;"> -	Emotional distress in the form of anger, anxiety or depression.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 15%;"> -	Tension such as headaches, back pain, jaw pain and muscular tension.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 15%;"> -	Digestive system problems such as stomach aches, constipation and diarrhoea. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 15%;"> …is treatable and easily manageable.(http://www.apa.org, n.d.) </p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 15%;"> B. Episodic Acute Stress... </h4>



<p> …is when acute stress is suffered from frequently. While is may die down occasionally, it is not as frequent as periods of calm between normal acute stress symptoms. </p>
        <img class="../img/helloSecondImage" src="typesOfStressEpisodicAcutStressGoalsTooHigh.jpg" style="float: left;">

<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> …usually caused by self-inflicted goals that are unreasonable or unrealistic. </p>
<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> …symptoms are generally in the form of: </p>
<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> -	Long periods of emotional distress in the form of depression, anxiety or anger. </p>
<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> -	Severe and prolonged periods of worry. </p>
<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> -	Physical symptoms much like with acute stress for prolonged periods of time. </p>
<p style="margin-right: 15%;"> -	Heart issues. (Sincero, 2012)</p>
<h4> C. Chronic Stress... </h4>

<p> …is seemingly unending periods of stress that become detrimental to an individual both physically and mentally. </p>
<p> …is caused by an overuse of the bodies stress response system. </p>
<p> …is a result of being constantly exposed to situations that are stressful for an individual and situations that cause the body to release the ‘stress hormones’. </p>
<p> …can cause many health issues such as heart diseases due to the fact that if the stress response system is overused, it begins effecting many other bodily systems including the cardiovascular system. (Humanstress.ca, n.d.) </p>


<p> (Legg, 2016) </p>

<h1> More Information </h1>

<h4> Not all stress is bad </h4>
<p> Acute stress can be quite beneficial in small doses as it allows for enhanced immune responses at times. Stress is also responsible for the ‘fight or flight’ response within living organisms.</p>
<p> This ‘flight or fight’ response is the nervous system’s way of responding to a threatening situation. It works through flooding the system with adrenaline as well as other hormones that prepare the body for fast responses in emergencies. There are some physical changes that can occur such as; increase of strength, speed, stamina and focus which prepares your body to engage in a fight or flee from danger. (Helpguide.org, n.d.)</p>
<p> Acute stress can also improve mental and physical functioning for short periods of time. (Dhabhar, 2012) </p>

<h4> Stress is bad when... </h4>

<p> It becomes episodic or chronic stress because this is when it begins to effect the body in detrimental and long-term ways. While short periods of stress can be beneficial to the immune systems, long periods of ‘bad’ stress can have the reverse effect. (Hansen, 2015) </p>

<h4> When stress becomes unmanageable, there are many people you can go to </h4>

<p> Depending on the cause of the stress, there are different steps you can take to reduce stress in everyday life. </p>

<p> Some people you may find comfort in talking to about stressors in your life include: </p>

<p> - Parents </p>
<p> - Other trusted adults </p>
<p> - Friends (understanding that they may be experiencing the same stress) </p>
<p> - Teachers (Mentor or otherwise) </p>
<p> - House Co-ordinator or Wellbeing Co-ordinator </p>
<p> - Older Siblings </p>
<p> - School Counsellor </p>
<p> - Assisant Principles </p>

<p> For those individuals who find themselves stressed due to Defense Force family life: </p>

<p> - Defense Transition Mentor </p>
<p> - Other Defense Students </p>

<h1> Causes of Stress </h1>

<h4> School life </h4>

<p> School is a major part of an adolescence’s life as they spend a large part of their day there. There is very little surprise when it comes to links between schooling and stressed out teenagers. Many people believe the reason behind this especially in Australia, is due to the large focus on academic outcomes and the idea that grades determine one’s future. </p>
<p> “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a FISH by its ability to climb a tree,
it will live its whole life believing that it is STUPID”
-	Matthew Kelly, ‘The Rhythm of Life:
Living Every Day with Passion and Purpose, 2004’ </p>

<p> Studies have shown that nearly half (47%) of Australian school kids are stressed in their every day life due to academic studies. This stress has been linked to lower academic achievement among the children suffering.  (Pascoe, 2018) </p>

<h4> Friendships </h4>

<p> Friendships are a major part of anyone’s support network and when these friendships falter it can put strain on a person. A study conducted in 2017 by the University of Michigan State suggested that people gain more both physically and mentally from friendships rather than their family. The results showed that people who believed they had stronger friendships were less likely to develop serious illnesses later in life. (Simon, 2017) </p>
<p> On the flip side, friends can also have a negative affect on people. If a friend exhibits behaviours such as lying, betrayal and insulting/ bullying, they can increase the stress levels of an individual. Especially when friends become overly needy and demanding of time, they can take away from other things such as school and increase stress levels. (Duenwald, 2002) </p>

<h4> Relationships </h4>

<p> High school and teenage years is when most people begin to explore romantic relationships or their sexuality. The want or need for this to occur can often put a lot of strain on people as they grow up, it is a natural part of puberty to begin to feel attracted to other people. While relationships, much like friendships can build a person up and make them happier, when relationships are not as supportive or welcoming they can have a negative affect. </p>
<p> These negative affects can be forced on a person through many different ways. Pressure within a relationship to begin exploring the sexual side of intimacy is an issue that many people face that can cause extreme amounts of stress especially when someone is not ready to begin exploring such things, they may feel scared of their partner leaving them. </p>
<p> Grades can also be affected by a teens relationship, through spending more time with your significant other rather than doing school work or assignments. Not only can relationships affect the quality of classroom work, it can also affect social status within the school, teenagers can begin labelling their peers based on their relationship status or sexual activity. (Ireland, 2015) </p>

    <img class="../img/helloThirdImage"src="SchoolStress.gif">
</center>

<h4> Family </h4>

<p> Parents can place a lot of expectations on adolescents in many different areas of life. Combining this with many other factors and stressors that come with some families, such as divorced or separated parents, siblings or general family life. (Villanueva, 2015) </p>
<p> Parental separation is a stressful time for children to have to deal with, adding the combined stress of any of the above factors and it can quickly overload a teen. Teenagers need ongoing support from parental units within this time and may be lacking that due to the separation. (Lodge, 2012) </p>

<h5> Australian Defence Force Family </h5>

<p> Children and teens with parents who serve in the Australian Defence Force can find themselves being stressed for a number different reasons. As ADF families are constantly moving to follow the parent who is being posted, change of environment and having to adjust to such a thing can cause a lot of stress as a child is expected to settle into a new school, home and build new friendships with each move. Children dealing with deployed parents is another level of added stress, especially when the aren’t is deployed to an unsafe environment with the risk of loosing their life. (Defence.gov.au, 2018) </p>

<h2> Theories of Stress </h2>

<h4> Frustration Agression Hypothesis </h4>

<p> The frustration Aggression hypothesis is the idea that when someone becomes frustrated or stressed about a certain event or situation, they release this through anger. It largely implies that aggression is a result of frustration. (Gonzalez, n.d.)
 </p>
<p> This links to stress through many different ways. Stress is a form of frustration that is generated when one is in an uncomfortable situation. The stress comes when an individual is attempting to achieve something however they are prevented from doing so whether it be through self inflicted or external barriers. </p>

<h4> Health Belief Model </h4>

<p> The health belief model is a psychological model that attempts to explain and predict health behaviours. This is done by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. The HBM has been adapted to explore a variety of long- and short-term health behaviours, including sexual risk behaviours and the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Your perceptions about your weight and the associated stress that comes with being unhealthy can prevent you from motivating yourself to exercise however, the HBM also allows for this stress to have a positive affect, explaining that it can also be a motivating factor in people’s lives. (University of Twente, n.d.)

<h2> Stress Managment Methods </h2>

<h4> Colouring </h4>

<p> Colouring allows for one to ‘switch off’ their brain from external thoughts and bring focus back to what is on the page in front of them. Colouring has been scientifically proven to occupy the same parts of the brain that stops conditions such as anxiety and stress, and allow for changed heart rates or brain waves. (Dovey, 2015)
 </p>

<center>
<img class="../img/helloFourthImage" src="colouringBooksMeme.jpg">
</center>
<h4> Gratitudes </h4>

<p> Stemming from ‘Positive Psychology’ comes the idea of Gratitudes and giving thanks. The idea behind gratitudes is appreciating what life has to offer and materialising it in some sense, particularly through writing it down. (Scott, 2017)
 </p>
<p> They can be something as simple as “I am grateful for my school uniform and that my mother ironed it for me today”. The challenge with this is remembering to write them every day. </p>
<p> My challenge to you, if you believe writing gratitudes will help with your stress is to write three of them down every night for the next three weeks and see how if effects your life </p>

<center>
<img class="../img/helloFithImage" src="gratitudes.jpg">
</center>

<h4> Journaling  </h4>

<p> Journaling is another stress management that allows for one to ‘switch off’ from external factors. By physically writing down feelings and thoughts, it forces people to remove themselves from any technology that can be causing or extending stress. It also allows for people to have an emotional outlet rather than bottling in things such as stress or sadness or anxiety. (HuffPost Australia, 2013)

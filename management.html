<h2> Stress Managment Methods </h2>

<h4> Colouring </h4>

<p> Colouring allows for one to ‘switch off’ their brain from external thoughts and bring focus back to what is on the page in front of them. Colouring has been scientifically proven to occupy the same parts of the brain that stops conditions such as anxiety and stress, and allow for changed heart rates or brain waves. (Dovey, 2015)
 </p>

<h4> Gratitudes </h4>

<p> Stemming from ‘Positive Psychology’ comes the idea of Gratitudes and giving thanks. The idea behind gratitudes is appreciating what life has to offer and materialising it in some sense, particularly through writing it down. (Scott, 2017)
 </p>
<p> They can be something as simple as “I am grateful for my school uniform and that my mother ironed it for me today”. The challenge with this is remembering to write them every day. </p>
<p> My challenge to you, if you believe writing gratitudes will help with your stress is to write three of them down every night for the next three weeks and see how if effects your life </p>

<h4> Journalling </h4>

<p> Journaling is another stress management that allows for one to ‘switch off’ from external factors. By physically writing down feelings and thoughts, it forces people to remove themselves from any technology that can be causing or extending stress. It also allows for people to have an emotional outlet rather than bottling in things such as stress or sadness or anxiety. (HuffPost Australia, 2013)

<h1> More Information </h1>

<h4> Not all stress is bad </h4>
<p> Acute stress can be quite beneficial in small doses as it allows for enhanced immune responses at times. Stress is also responsible for the ‘fight or flight’ response within living organisms.</p>
<p> This ‘flight or fight’ response is the nervous system’s way of responding to a threatening situation. It works through flooding the system with adrenaline as well as other hormones that prepare the body for fast responses in emergencies. There are some physical changes that can occur such as; increase of strength, speed, stamina and focus which prepares your body to engage in a fight or flee from danger.</p>
<p> Acute stress can also improve mental and physical functioning for short periods of time. </p>

<h4> Stress is bad when... </h4>

<p> It becomes episodic or chronic stress because this is when it begins to effect the body in detrimental and long-term ways. While short periods of stress can be beneficial to the immune systems, long periods of ‘bad’ stress can have the reverse effect. </p>

<h4> When stress becomes unmanageable, there are many people you can go to </h4>

<p> Depending on the cause of the stress, there are different steps you can take to reduce stress in everyday life. </p>

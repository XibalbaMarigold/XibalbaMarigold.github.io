<h1> More Information </h1>

<h4> Not all stress is bad </h4>
<p> Acute stress can be quite beneficial in small doses as it allows for enhanced immune responses at times. Stress is also responsible for the ‘fight or flight’ response within living organisms.</p>
<p> Acute stress can also improve mental and physical functioning for short periods of time. </p>

<h4> Stress is bad when... </h4>

<p> It becomes episodic or chronic stress because this is when it begins to effect the body in detrimental and long-term ways. While short periods of stress can be beneficial to the immune systems, long periods of ‘bad’ stress can have the reverse effect. </p>

<h4> When stress becomes unmanageable, there are many people you can go to </h4>

<p> Depending on the cause of the stress, there are different steps you can take to reduce stress in everyday life. </p>

<p> Some people you may find comfort in talking to about stressors in your life include: </p>

<p> - Parents </p>
<p> - Other trusted adults </p>
<p> - Friends (understanding that they may be experiencing the same stress) </p>
<p> - Teachers (Mentor or otherwise) </p>
<p> - House Co-ordinator or Wellbeing Co-ordinator </p>
<p> - Older Siblings </p>
<p> - School Counsellor </p>
<p> - Assisant Principles </p>
